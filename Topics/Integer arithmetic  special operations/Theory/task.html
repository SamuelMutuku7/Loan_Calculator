<p>In Python, operators are fundamental tools for performing various <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/47917" target="_blank" title="In Python, an operation is a process or function that is performed on one or more values or variables. | This can include arithmetic operations such as addition or subtraction, as well as other types of operations like comparison or set operations. For example, you can perform a union operation on two sets to create a new set that contains all the elements of both initial sets. This can be done using the `union()` method or the `` operator. In the context of objects, defining methods for certain operations allows you to specify how those operations should be performed for that specific object.">operations</a> on data. Two operators that offer unique functionalities are the modulus operator <code class="java">%</code> and the exponentiation operator <code class="java">**</code>.</p>
<ul><li><p><strong>Modulus Operator (%):</strong> This operator calculates the remainder of a division operation. For example, <code class="java">7 % 3</code> returns <code class="java">1</code>, as 7 divided by 3 equals 2 with a remainder of 1.</p></li><li><p><strong>Exponentiation Operator (**)</strong>: This operator raises a number to a power. For instance, <code class="java">2 ** 3</code> results in <code class="java">8</code>, as 2 raised to the power of 3 equals 8.</p></li></ul>
<p>Understanding the precedence of operators is crucial for determining the order in which operations are performed. In Python, the precedence hierarchy is as follows (from highest to lowest precedence):</p>
<div class="alert alert-primary"><p>Parentheses &gt; Exponentiation &gt; Multiplication = Division = Integer Division = Modulo &gt; Addition = Subtraction</p></div>
<p>Parentheses can be used to override the default precedence and force operations to occur in a specific order.</p>
<p>By mastering the usage and precedence of these operators, you gain the ability to manipulate data effectively and efficiently in Python.</p>
